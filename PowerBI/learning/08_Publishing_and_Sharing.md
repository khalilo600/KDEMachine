# 8. Publishing and Sharing in Power BI

Once you have created a report in Power BI Desktop, you can publish it to the **Power BI service** to share it with others.

## The Power BI Service

The Power BI service is an online SaaS (Software as a Service) service where you can host your Power BI reports, dashboards, and datasets.

## Publishing a Report

To publish a report from Power BI Desktop to the Power BI service, you need to have a Power BI account.

To publish a report, click the `Publish` button on the Home ribbon in Power BI Desktop. You will be prompted to sign in to your Power BI account and select a workspace to publish the report to.

## Workspaces

A workspace is a container for your Power BI content. You can create workspaces to organize your reports, dashboards, and datasets.

There are two types of workspaces:

*   **My Workspace:** Your personal workspace for your own content.
*   **App Workspaces:** Workspaces for collaborating with others.

## Dashboards

A dashboard is a single page, often called a canvas, that tells a story through visualizations. Dashboards are created in the Power BI service.

You can pin visualizations from your reports to a dashboard. When you click on a tile on a dashboard, it will take you to the underlying report.

## Sharing Your Content

There are several ways to share your content in the Power BI service:

*   **Share reports and dashboards:** You can share your reports and dashboards directly with other users.
*   **Publish an app:** You can create an app that contains a collection of reports and dashboards. You can then publish the app to your entire organization or to specific users or groups.
*   **Embed in SharePoint Online:** You can embed your reports in SharePoint Online pages.
*   **Publish to web:** You can publish your reports to the public web. **Use this option with caution, as it will make your data visible to anyone on the internet.**

## Row-Level Security (RLS)

Row-level security (RLS) allows you to restrict data access for certain users. You can define roles and rules that filter data at the row level.

For example, you could create a role that only allows salespeople to see their own sales data.
