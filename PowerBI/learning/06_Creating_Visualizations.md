# 6. Creating Visualizations in Power BI

Visualizations (or visuals) are the charts, graphs, and maps that you use to tell a story with your data.

## The Visualizations Pane

The Visualizations pane in Power BI Desktop is where you create and manage your visualizations. It contains a list of all the available visualization types, as well as the options for configuring the selected visualization.

## Common Visualization Types

Power BI comes with a number of built-in visualization types:

*   **Tables and Matrices:** Display data in a tabular format.
*   **Bar and Column Charts:** Compare values across categories.
*   **Line and Area Charts:** Show trends over time.
*   **Pie and Donut Charts:** Show the proportion of a total.
*   **Maps:** Display data on a geographical map.
*   **Cards:** Display a single, important number.
*   **Slicers:** Allow users to filter the data on the report page.

## Creating a Visualization

To create a visualization, you can either drag a field from the **Fields** pane onto the report canvas, or you can select a visualization type from the **Visualizations** pane and then add fields to it.

## Formatting Visualizations

You can customize the appearance of your visualizations using the **Format** pane. The Format pane allows you to change the colors, fonts, labels, and other properties of your visualizations.

## Custom Visuals

In addition to the built-in visualization types, you can also download custom visuals from the **AppSource marketplace**. Custom visuals are created by third-party developers and can provide new and interesting ways to visualize your data.

## Our Sample Visualizations

Here are some of the visualizations we will create using our `sales_data` dataset:

*   A **bar chart** showing the total revenue by country.
*   A **line chart** showing the total revenue over time.
*   A **map** showing the total revenue by region.
*   A **pie chart** showing the proportion of sales by category.
*   A **slicer** to filter the report by salesperson.
