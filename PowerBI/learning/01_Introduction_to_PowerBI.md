# 1. Introduction to Power BI

**Power BI** is a business analytics service by Microsoft. It provides interactive visualizations and business intelligence capabilities with an interface simple enough for end users to create their own reports and dashboards.

## What is Power BI?

Power BI is a collection of software services, apps, and connectors that work together to turn your unrelated sources of data into coherent, visually immersive, and interactive insights. Your data may be an Excel spreadsheet, or a collection of cloud-based and on-premises hybrid data warehouses.

## The Parts of Power BI

Power BI consists of several elements that all work together, starting with these three basics:

*   A Windows desktop application called **Power BI Desktop**.
*   An online SaaS (Software as a Service) service called the **Power BI service**.
*   Power BI **mobile apps** for Windows, iOS, and Android devices.

## The Flow of Work in Power BI

A common flow of work in Power BI begins in Power BI Desktop, where a report is created. That report is then published to the Power BI service, and then shared so users of Power BI Mobile apps can consume the information.

It doesn't always happen that way, and that's okay, but that's a common workflow.

## The Building Blocks of Power BI

Everything you do in Power BI can be broken down into the following basic building blocks:

*   **Visualizations:** A visual representation of data, like a chart or a graph.
*   **Datasets:** A collection of data that Power BI uses to create its visualizations.
*   **Reports:** A collection of visualizations that appear together on one or more pages.
*   **Dashboards:** A single page, often called a canvas, that tells a story through visualizations.
*   **Tiles:** A single visualization on a report or a dashboard.

## Our Sample Data

For this tutorial, we will be using a messy sales dataset (`sales_data.csv`) located in the `data` directory. This dataset will require cleaning and transformation before it can be used for analysis, which is a common task in Power BI.
