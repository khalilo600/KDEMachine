/*
At the core of CSS layout is the relationship between an element and its parent, often called its "containing block".

1. The Box Model:
Every HTML element is a box. This box has:
- Content: The text, image, etc.
- Padding: The space between the content and the border.
- Border: A line around the padding and content.
- Margin: The space outside the border, between this box and other elements.

2. Containing Block:
The containing block is the "area" that an element lives in. The size and position of an element are often calculated based on its containing block.

- For `position: static` (the default) and `position: relative`, the containing block is the content area of the nearest block-level ancestor (like a <div>, <p>, or <body>).
- For `position: absolute`, the containing block is the padding area of the nearest ancestor that has a `position` value other than `static` (e.g., `relative`, `absolute`, `fixed`, or `sticky`).
- For `position: fixed`, the containing block is the viewport (the browser window).

3. `display: block` vs `display: inline`

- `display: block` (like <div>, <p>, <h1>):
  - Takes up the full width of its parent container (its containing block).
  - Starts on a new line.
  - Respects `width`, `height`, `margin-top`, `margin-bottom`, `padding`.

- `display: inline` (like <span>, <a>, <img>):
  - Takes up only as much width as its content needs.
  - Does not start on a new line.
  - Only respects `margin-left`, `margin-right`, `padding-left`, `padding-right`. It does NOT respect `width`, `height`, `margin-top`, or `margin-bottom`.
