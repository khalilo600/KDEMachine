# Phase 3: Testing

Testing is the process of checking if your code works as expected. Writing tests is an important part of web development. It helps you to ensure that your code is correct, and it gives you the confidence to make changes to your code without breaking anything.

## Key Concepts

### 1. Unit Tests

A unit test is a test that checks a small, isolated piece of code, such as a function or a method.

*   Django provides a test framework that is built on top of Python's `unittest` module.
*   **`TestCase`:** A class that you can use to write your tests.

## Bookstore Features to Implement

*   **Implement tests for critical paths:**
    1.  Write tests for your models.
    2.  Write tests for your views.
    3.  Write tests for your forms.
    4.  Write tests for critical paths, such as adding a book to the cart and processing an order.
