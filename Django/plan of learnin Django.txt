Creating a full-featured bookstore application in Django is an excellent way to practice and demonstrate full-stack web development skills. Here is a learning plan, broken down into manageable phases with key concepts and features to implement.

## 🚀 Phase 1: Foundation and Core Catalog (Beginner)

This phase focuses on setting up your project, understanding the **Model-View-Template (MVT)** structure, and implementing the core catalog features.

| Focus Area | Key Concepts | Bookstore Features to Implement |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Project Setup** | Python, **Virtual Environments**, `django-admin startproject/startapp`, `settings.py` (Installed Apps, Database), `urls.py`. | Initialize project and a 'books' app. |
| **Data Modeling** | **Django Models**, Model fields (`CharField`, `IntegerField`, `TextField`, `ForeignKey`, `ImageField`), **Migrations**. | `Book` Model (Title, Author, ISBN, Price, Cover Image), `Category` Model. |
| **Admin Interface** | Registering models in `admin.py`, using the built-in **Django Admin** to create initial data (books and categories). | CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for books via the Admin. |
| **Displaying Data** | **Function-Based Views (FBVs)** or **Class-Based Views (CBVs)** (e.g., `ListView`, `DetailView`), **Django Templates** (`{% extends %}`, `{% block %}`, template variables). | **Book List Page** (display all books), **Book Detail Page** (display one book's info). |

## 💻 Phase 2: User Experience and Interaction (Intermediate)

Here you will integrate core e-commerce and web application features like user management, search, and the shopping cart.

| Focus Area | Key Concepts | Bookstore Features to Implement |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **User Authentication** | Built-in **Django Auth** (`User` model), Authentication Views (Login, Logout), **User Registration**. | User login and registration pages. Restrict 'add/edit' views to logged-in users or staff. |
| **E-commerce Logic** | **Sessions** and **Cookies**, creating an in-memory or database-backed **Shopping Cart** structure. | `Cart` Model/logic (or use sessions for simple cart), **Add to Cart** functionality. |
| **Form Handling** | **Django Forms** (ModelForms), form validation, handling `GET` and `POST` requests in views. | Search bar implementation using **`Q` objects** for complex database lookups (Title or Author). |
| **Content Management** | Implementing a view and form for users or staff to **Add/Edit Books** (CRUD in the front-end). | Forms for adding/editing books and handling image uploads (requires Pillow). |

-----

## 💳 Phase 3: E-commerce Functionality and Deployment (Advanced)

This final phase tackles the critical e-commerce components, advanced configuration, and prepares the application for a real-world environment.

| Focus Area | Key Concepts | Bookstore Features to Implement |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Checkout & Orders** | Creating **Order** and **OrderItem** models, transactional integrity. | Implement a **Checkout Process** (shipping details form) and **Order History** for users. |
| **Payment Integration** | Using external services and packages (e.g., **Stripe** or **PayPal** with **`django-stripe-payments`** or similar). | Securely integrate a payment gateway to process mock or real payments. |
| **Custom User Model** | Extending the default `User` model for custom profile information (e.g., shipping address). | Custom `User` model to link to orders and addresses. |
| **Deployment Prep** | Managing **Static** and **Media Files**, using **WhiteNoise** or **Amazon S3** for production, basic **Security** principles (CSRF, XSS). | Configure for production-ready deployment (e.g., on Heroku, AWS, or DigitalOcean). |
| **Testing** | Writing **Unit Tests** for models, views, and forms using Django's **`TestCase`**. | Implement tests for critical paths (e.g., adding a book, processing an order). |
