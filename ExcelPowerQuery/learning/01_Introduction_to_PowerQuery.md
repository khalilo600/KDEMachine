# 1. Introduction to Power Query

**Power Query** (also known as **Get & Transform Data** in Excel) is a data connection technology that enables you to discover, connect, combine, and refine data across a wide variety of sources.

## What is Power Query?

Power Query is a data transformation and data preparation engine. It comes with a graphical interface for getting data from sources and a Power Query Editor for applying transformations.

With Power Query, you can perform the ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) of data. You can extract data from various sources, transform the data into the shape you want, and then load it into Excel or a Power BI model.

## Where to Find Power Query in Excel

In Excel 2016 and later, Power Query is integrated into the `Data` tab under the `Get & Transform Data` group.

*   **From Text/CSV:** Connect to a text or CSV file.
*   **From Web:** Connect to a web page.
*   **From Table/Range:** Load data from an Excel table or range.
*   **Get Data:** Access a wide range of other data sources.

## The Power Query Workflow

The Power Query workflow consists of three main steps:

1.  **Connect:** Connect to data in the cloud, on a service, or locally.
2.  **Transform:** Shape data to meet your needs, while the original source remains unchanged.
3.  **Load:** Load the transformed data into an Excel worksheet or a Data Model.

## Why Use Power Query?

Power Query is a powerful tool for anyone who works with data in Excel. Here are some of the benefits of using Power Query:

*   **Repeatable Transformations:** Power Query records every transformation step you take. When you refresh your data, the same transformations are applied automatically.
*   **No Formulas:** You can perform complex transformations without writing a single formula.
*   **Connect to Multiple Sources:** You can connect to a wide variety of data sources.
*   **Clean and Shape Data:** You can clean and shape messy data with ease.

## Our Sample Data

For this tutorial, we will be using the `sales_data.csv` file located in the `data` directory. This dataset is messy and will require cleaning and transformation using Power Query.
