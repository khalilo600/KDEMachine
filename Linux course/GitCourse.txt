**Section 1: Introduction to Git & Version Control**

*   **What is Version Control?**
    *   Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later.
    *   It allows you to revert files back to a previous state, revert the entire project back to a previous state, compare changes over time, see who last modified something that might be causing a problem, who introduced an issue and when, and more.

*   **What is Git?**
    *   Git is a free and open-source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.
    *   **Distributed:** Every developer has a full copy of the project's history, which makes it fast and allows for offline work.

*   **What is GitHub?**
    *   GitHub is a web-based hosting service for version control using Git. It provides a graphical interface and collaboration features like bug tracking, feature requests, and task management.

**Section 2: Getting Started**

*   **Installing Git:**
    *   **Linux (Debian/Ubuntu):** `sudo apt-get install git`
    *   **Linux (Fedora):** `sudo dnf install git`
    *   **macOS:** `brew install git` (if you have Homebrew) or install the Xcode Command Line Tools.
    *   **Windows:** Download and install Git from [https://git-scm.com/downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

*   **First-Time Git Configuration:**
    *   Before you start using Git, you need to configure it with your name and email address. This is important because every Git commit uses this information.
    *   **Exercise:**
        1.  Open your terminal.
        2.  Set your username:
            ```bash
            git config --global user.name "Your Name"
            ```
        3.  Set your email address:
            ```bash
            git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
            ```
        4.  You can check your configuration with:
            ```bash
            git config --list
            ```

**Section 3: Core Git Concepts**

*   **The Three States:**
    *   Git has three main states that your files can reside in:
        1.  **Modified:** You have changed the file but have not committed it to your database yet.
        2.  **Staged:** You have marked a modified file in its current version to go into your next commit snapshot.
        3.  **Committed:** The data is safely stored in your local database.

*   **The `.git` Directory:**
    *   When you initialize a Git repository in a directory, Git creates a hidden `.git` directory.
    *   This directory contains all the information about your project's history, configuration, and more. You generally don't need to touch the files in this directory directly.

---

**Section 4: Basic Git Commands**

*   **`git init`:**
    *   Initializes a new Git repository.
    *   **Exercise:**
        1.  Create a new directory called `my-git-project`.
        2.  Navigate into the directory: `cd my-git-project`
        3.  Initialize a new Git repository: `git init`

*   **`git add`:**
    *   Adds a change in the working directory to the staging area.
    *   **Exercise:**
        1.  Create a new file called `README.md`.
        2.  Add some text to the file.
        3.  Add the file to the staging area: `git add README.md`

*   **`git status`:**
    *   Displays the state of the working directory and the staging area.
    *   **Exercise:**
        1.  Run `git status` to see that `README.md` is staged and ready to be committed.

*   **`git commit`:**
    *   Takes a snapshot of the staged changes and saves it to the project's history.
    *   **Exercise:**
        1.  Commit the staged changes with a message:
            ```bash
            git commit -m "Initial commit"
            ```

*   **`git log`:**
    *   Shows the commit history for the current branch.
    *   **Exercise:**
        1.  Run `git log` to see your first commit.

---

**Section 5: Branching & Merging**

*   **What is a Branch?**
    *   A branch is a lightweight, movable pointer to a commit. The default branch name in Git is `main` (or `master` in older versions).
    *   Branching allows you to diverge from the main line of development and continue to do work without messing with that main line.

*   **`git branch`:**
    *   Lists all of the branches in your repository.
    *   **Exercise:**
        1.  Create a new branch called `new-feature`:
            ```bash
            git branch new-feature
            ```
        2.  Run `git branch` to see your new branch.

*   **`git checkout`:**
    *   Switches to a different branch.
    *   **Exercise:**
        1.  Switch to your new branch:
            ```bash
            git checkout new-feature
            ```

*   **`git merge`:**
    *   Merges the specified branch's history into the current branch.
    *   **Exercise:**
        1.  On the `new-feature` branch, create a new file called `feature.txt`.
        2.  Add and commit the new file.
        3.  Switch back to the `main` branch: `git checkout main`
        4.  Merge the `new-feature` branch into `main`:
            ```bash
            git merge new-feature
            ```
        5.  Run `ls` to see that `feature.txt` is now in the `main` branch.

**Section 6: Remote Repositories & GitHub**

*   **What is a Remote?**
    *   A remote is a common repository that all team members use to exchange their changes.

*   **`git remote`:**
    *   Manages the set of remotes that you are tracking.
    *   **Exercise:**
        1.  Go to [https://github.com](https://github.com) and create a new repository called `my-git-project`.
        2.  Copy the repository's URL.
        3.  Add a new remote called `origin`:
            ```bash
            git remote add origin <repository_url>
            ```

*   **`git push`:**
    *   Uploads your local repository content to a remote repository.
    *   **Exercise:**
        1.  Push your `main` branch to the `origin` remote:
            ```bash
            git push -u origin main
            ```

*   **`git pull`:**
    *   Fetches changes from a remote repository and merges them into your current branch.

*   **`git clone`:**
    *   Creates a local copy of a remote repository.
    *   **Exercise:**
        1.  Go to a different directory on your computer.
        2.  Clone the repository you just pushed to GitHub:
            ```bash
            git clone <repository_url>
            ```

**Section 7: Advanced Topics**

*   **`git stash`:**
    *   Temporarily shelves (or stashes) changes you've made to your working copy so you can work on something else, and then come back and re-apply them later on.

*   **`git rebase`:**
    *   Re-applies commits on top of another base tip. It's an alternative to merging.

*   **`git tag`:**
    *   Marks specific points in history as being important. Typically used to mark release points (e.g., `v1.0`).

---

**Section 8: Git Best Practices**

*   **Commit Messages:**
    *   Write clear and concise commit messages.
    *   The first line should be a short summary (50 characters or less).
    *   The body of the commit message should provide more detail.

*   **Branching Strategy:**
    *   Use a branching strategy like GitFlow to keep your repository organized.
    *   Create a new branch for each new feature or bug fix.
    *   Keep your `main` branch clean and deployable.

**Section 9: Connecting to GitHub with SSH**

*   **What is SSH?**
    *   SSH (Secure Shell) is a cryptographic network protocol for operating network services securely over an unsecured network.
    *   Using SSH with Git allows you to connect to your remote repositories without having to enter your username and password every time.

*   **Step 1: Check for Existing SSH Keys**
    *   First, check if you already have an SSH key.
    *   **Exercise:**
        1.  Open your terminal.
        2.  Run the following command:
            ```bash
            ls -al ~/.ssh
            ```
        3.  If you see files named `id_rsa.pub` or `id_ed25519.pub`, you already have an SSH key and can skip to Step 3.

*   **Step 2: Generate a New SSH Key**
    *   If you don't have an SSH key, you can generate one.
    *   **Exercise:**
        1.  Run the following command, replacing the email address with your own:
            ```bash
            ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your.email@example.com"
            ```
        2.  When prompted to "Enter a file in which to save the key," press Enter to accept the default location.
        3.  When prompted, enter a secure passphrase.

*   **Step 3: Add Your SSH Key to the ssh-agent**
    *   The ssh-agent is a background program that handles passwords for SSH private keys.
    *   **Exercise:**
        1.  Start the ssh-agent in the background:
            ```bash
            eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
            ```
        2.  Add your SSH private key to the ssh-agent:
            ```bash
            ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
            ```

*   **Step 4: Add Your SSH Key to Your GitHub Account**
    *   The final step is to add your public SSH key to your GitHub account.
    *   **Exercise:**
        1.  Copy your public SSH key to your clipboard. On Linux, you can do this with:
            ```bash
            cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub | xclip -selection clipboard
            ```
            (You may need to install `xclip`: `sudo apt-get install xclip`)
        2.  Go to your GitHub account settings.
        3.  Click on "SSH and GPG keys" in the sidebar.
        4.  Click "New SSH key" or "Add SSH key."
        5.  In the "Title" field, add a descriptive label for the new key.
        6.  Paste your key into the "Key" field.
        7.  Click "Add SSH key."
