    *   `grep`: Search for patterns in text. `grep "error" /var/log/syslog`
    *   `sed`: A "stream editor" for filtering and transforming text. `sed 's/foo/bar/g' filename.txt`
    *   `awk`: A versatile programming language for text processing. `awk '{print $1}' filename.txt`
    *   **Exercise:**
        1.  Use `grep` to find all the lines in `/etc/passwd` that contain the word "bash".
        2.  Use `sed` to replace all instances of "bash" with "sh" in `/etc/passwd` (don't save the changes, just view the output).

**System Administration:**

*   `systemd`: The standard init system and service manager for most modern Linux distributions.
*   `logging`:
    *   `journalctl`: Query the `systemd` journal. `journalctl -u nginx.service`
    *   `/var/log`: The traditional directory for system logs.
*   `cron` jobs (`crontab`): Schedule commands or scripts to run at specific times.
    *   **Exercise:**

    *   "Command not found": Make sure the command is installed and in your `PATH`.
    *   Application not starting: Check logs (`journalctl` or in `/var/log`).
*   **Diagnostic Commands:**
    *   `dmesg`: Kernel ring buffer messages.
    *   `lsof`: List open files.
    *   `strace`: Trace system calls and signals.

**Understanding `man` Pages**

The `man` command (short for "manual") is your best friend on the Linux command line. It provides detailed documentation for most of the commands you'll use.

To use it, simply type `man` followed by the name of the command you want to learn about. For example:

```bash
man ls
```

This will open the manual page for the `ls` command.

If a command or topic exists in multiple `man` sections, you can specify the section number before the command name. For example, to view the `passwd` file format (section 5) instead of the `passwd` command (section 1):

```bash
man 5 passwd
```

**Navigating `man` Pages**

Once you open a `man` page, you'll be in a pager program (usually `less`). Here are some common keys for navigation:

*   **Spacebar** or **f**: Scroll forward one page.
*   **b**: Scroll backward one page.
*   **Enter** or **j**: Scroll forward one line.
*   **k**: Scroll backward one line.
*   **g**: Go to the beginning of the `man` page.
*   **G**: Go to the end of the `man` page.
*   **/**: Search forward for a pattern. Type your search term and press Enter. Press `n` for the next match, `N` for the previous.
*   **?**: Search backward for a pattern.
*   **q**: Quit the `man` page.

**`man` Page Sections**

`man` pages are divided into numbered sections. Here's a breakdown of the most common sections:

*   **1 - Executable programs or shell commands:** This is the section you'll use most often. It contains documentation for the commands you run in your terminal.
*   **2 - System calls:** These are functions that the kernel provides for programs to use.
*   **3 - Library calls:** These are functions within program libraries (like the standard C library).
*   **4 - Special files:** This section describes special files, usually found in `/dev`.
*   **5 - File formats and conventions:** This section describes the format of various files, like `/etc/passwd`.
*   **6 - Games:** Yes, some Linux systems come with games, and this is where you'll find their documentation.
*   **7 - Miscellaneous:** This section is a catch-all for various other topics.
*   **8 - System administration commands:** These are commands that are generally used by the system administrator (the "root" user).
*   **9 - Kernel routines:** This section is for kernel developers.

**Exercise:**

1.  Open the `man` page for the `man` command itself: `man man`.
2.  Practice navigating using the keys mentioned above (Spacebar, b, /, q).
3.  Read through the `DESCRIPTION` section to learn more about how `man` pages are structured.
4.  Try to find the `man` page for `passwd` in section 5: `man 5 passwd`. How is this different from the `man` page for `passwd` in section 1 (`man 1 passwd`)?
