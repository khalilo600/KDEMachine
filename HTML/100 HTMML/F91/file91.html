    <h1>Meta and Base Elements</h1>
    <p>Meta tags provide metadata about the HTML document. They are not displayed on the page but are parsed by browsers and search engines.</p>
    <p>The base tag specifies the base URL/target for all relative URLs in a document.</p>
    <p>These elements are primarily for document configuration and SEO, and are not directly styled by CSS in the same way as visible elements.</p>
