# 7. What-If Analysis in Excel

**What-If Analysis** is the process of changing the values in cells to see how those changes will affect the outcome of formulas on the worksheet.

Excel provides three What-If Analysis tools:

*   **Scenarios**
*   **Goal Seek**
*   **Data Tables**

## Scenarios

A **scenario** is a set of values that Excel saves and can substitute automatically in cells on your worksheet. You can create and save different groups of values as scenarios and then switch between these scenarios to view the different results.

To create a scenario, click `Data` > `What-If Analysis` > `Scenario Manager`.

## Goal Seek

**Goal Seek** is a tool that allows you to find the input value that will produce a desired result. For example, if you know what result you want from a formula, but are not sure what input value the formula needs to get that result, you can use the Goal Seek feature.

To use Goal Seek, click `Data` > `What-If Analysis` > `Goal Seek`.

### Goal Seek Example

Let's say you have a formula that calculates the total cost of a loan. You can use Goal Seek to find out what interest rate you would need to get a specific monthly payment.

## Data Tables

A **data table** is a range of cells that shows how changing one or two variables in your formulas will affect the results of those formulas.

There are two types of data tables:

*   **One-variable data table:** Shows how changing one variable will affect the results of one or more formulas.
*   **Two-variable data table:** Shows how changing two variables will affect the results of one formula.

To create a data table, click `Data` > `What-If Analysis` > `Data Table`.

## Solver

The **Solver** is a more advanced What-If Analysis tool that can be used to find the optimal solution to a problem. The Solver can be used to find the maximum or minimum value of a cell by changing other cells, subject to constraints.

The Solver is an add-in that is not enabled by default. To enable the Solver, go to `File` > `Options` > `Add-ins`.
