# 3. Data Tools in Excel

Excel provides a number of tools for working with data.

## Sorting

You can sort your data by one or more columns. To sort your data, select the data you want to sort and then click the `Sort` button on the `Data` tab.

## Filtering

You can filter your data to show only the rows that meet certain criteria. To filter your data, select the data you want to filter and then click the `Filter` button on the `Data` tab.

## Text to Columns

The Text to Columns tool allows you to split a single column of text into multiple columns. This is useful when you have data that is in a delimited format (e.g., comma-separated, tab-separated).

To use the Text to Columns tool, select the column you want to split and then click `Data` > `Text to Columns`.

## Flash Fill

Flash Fill is a feature that automatically fills in data when it senses a pattern. For example, if you have a column of full names and you start typing the first names in the next column, Flash Fill will automatically fill in the rest of the first names for you.

## Remove Duplicates

The Remove Duplicates tool allows you to remove duplicate rows from your data. To use the Remove Duplicates tool, select the data you want to remove duplicates from and then click `Data` > `Remove Duplicates`.

## Data Validation

Data Validation allows you to control the type of data that can be entered into a cell. You can use data validation to:

*   Restrict data entry to a specific data type (e.g., number, date, text).
*   Restrict data entry to a specific range of values.
*   Create a dropdown list of allowed values.

To use data validation, select the cells you want to apply data validation to and then click `Data` > `Data Validation`.

## Consolidate

The Consolidate tool allows you to combine data from multiple ranges into a single range. You can use the Consolidate tool to summarize data from multiple worksheets or workbooks.

To use the Consolidate tool, click `Data` > `Consolidate`.
