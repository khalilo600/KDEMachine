# 1. Introduction to Excel

**Microsoft Excel** is a spreadsheet program developed by Microsoft. It features calculation, graphing tools, pivot tables, and a macro programming language called Visual Basic for Applications (VBA).

## The Excel Interface

The Excel interface is made up of several key components:

*   **The Ribbon:** The ribbon at the top of the window contains the various tools and commands.
*   **The Formula Bar:** The Formula Bar shows the contents of the selected cell.
*   **The Worksheet:** The worksheet is a grid of cells where you enter and work with your data.
*   **The Status Bar:** The Status Bar at the bottom of the window shows information about the current selection.

## Cells, Rows, and Columns

A worksheet is made up of **cells**, which are organized into **rows** and **columns**.

*   **Columns** are identified by letters (A, B, C, ...).
*   **Rows** are identified by numbers (1, 2, 3, ...).
*   A **cell** is the intersection of a row and a column. Each cell has a unique address, such as A1, B2, or C3.

## Data Entry

You can enter three types of data into a cell:

*   **Text:** Any combination of letters, numbers, and symbols.
*   **Numbers:** Numeric values.
*   **Formulas:** A formula is an expression that performs a calculation.

## Formatting

Excel provides a wide range of formatting options that you can use to change the appearance of your data.

You can:

*   Change the font, size, and color of your text.
*   Apply number formatting (e.g., currency, percentage, date).
*   Add borders and shading to your cells.
*   Align the text in your cells.
